# Hyperspectral Image Classification with Machine Learning Algorithms
This GitHub repository hosts code and resources for hyperspectral image classification using machine learning algorithms like SVM, KNN, and RF. Our aim is to pinpoint the most accurate classification model by systematically testing various feature selection and extraction techniques. Explore Jupyter notebooks, datasets, and ground truth data for streamlined experimentation in hyperspectral image analysis.
